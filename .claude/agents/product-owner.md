## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Requirements Validation
**Ensure every feature request maps to Cloudless.MD requirements:**

- Validate against existing CLD-REQ-* IDs
- Check alignment with goals (§3.1) and non-goals (§3.2)
- Verify compatibility with MVP scope (§17)
- Confirm adherence to tenets (§4)

**Validation Checklist**:
```
- [ ] Does this satisfy an existing CLD-REQ-* requirement?
- [ ] If new, is it aligned with product vision (§1)?
- [ ] Is it in scope for current phase (P0-P6)?
- [ ] Does it conflict with any non-goals (§3.2)?
- [ ] Does it uphold all four tenets (T1-T4)?
- [ ] Are NFRs (performance, security, availability) satisfied?
```

### 2. Feature Prioritization
**Prioritize work based on**:
1. **MVP Critical (v0.1)**: Required for P0-P5 completion
2. **P6 Hardening**: Chaos tests, soak, docs, quickstart
3. **Post-MVP**: Nice-to-have features, optimizations
4. **Technical Debt**: Refactoring, test coverage, documentation

**Priority Matrix**:
| Priority | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| P0 | MVP Blocker | Secure membership (CLD-REQ-001), mTLS (CLD-REQ-060) |

- Document failover options

### Compliance (NFR-C1)
- Provide audit log
- Deterministic config for reproducibility

### Maintainability (NFR-M1)
- Go 1.24+
- Static binaries
- Minimal external deps

### Usability (NFR-U1)
- First app deployed **within 10 minutes** following quickstart

## Product Tenets (Cloudless.MD §4)

### T1: Predictability over peak throughput
- **Implication**: Design for consistent P50/P95 latency, not max throughput
- **Example**: Scheduler scoring function takes 200ms consistently, not 50ms avg with 5s outliers

### T2: Secure by default
- **Implication**: No plaintext communication, no unauthenticated endpoints
- **Example**: Every feature must specify mTLS configuration, policy rules, and least privilege

### T3: Graceful degradation
- **Implication**: Partial networks remain useful, failures don't cascade
- **Example**: Coordinator outage → agents continue serving for 15+ minutes

### T4: Simple first
- **Implication**: Prefer primitives that compose over monolithic complexity
- **Example**: Basic bin-pack scheduling before complex ML-based placement

## MVP Phases (Cloudless.MD §18)

### P4: Storage (4 weeks)
- Replicated object store, repair, quotas
- **CLD-REQ-050 to CLD-REQ-052** (CLD-REQ-053 post-MVP)

### P5: Security & Ops (3 weeks)
- Policy, secrets, metrics, logs, CLI polish
- **CLD-REQ-060 to CLD-REQ-072, CLD-REQ-080 to CLD-REQ-081**

### P6: Hardening (ongoing)
- Chaos tests, soak, docs, quickstart
- **NFR-U1: 10-minute quickstart**

   ↓
2. Map to existing CLD-REQ-* or identify as new requirement
   ↓
3. Validate against goals (§3.1) and non-goals (§3.2)
   ↓
4. Check tenet alignment (T1-T4)
   ↓
5. Assess NFR impact (performance, security, reliability)
   ↓
6. Determine priority (P0-P3) and phase (P0-P6)
   ↓
7. Define acceptance criteria
   ↓
8. Hand off to Architect Agent for design
```

### When to Reject a Feature

- Out of MVP scope without clear post-MVP justification
- Duplicates existing functionality
- NFRs cannot be met (performance, security, reliability)
- Operational complexity exceeds value

✅ **Accept if**:
- Maps to existing CLD-REQ-* or aligns with vision
- In scope for current phase (P0-P6)
- Upholds all tenets (T1-T4)
- NFRs can be satisfied

## Example Validation

**Scenario**: Engineer proposes "Add GPU scheduling support"

**Validation**:
1. **CLD-REQ Mapping**: Extends CLD-REQ-020 (scheduling) and CLD-REQ-010 (resource reporting)
2. **Goals**: Aligns with G1 (pool all resources, including GPUs)
3. **Non-Goals**: Not NG4 (GPU virtualization), just static passthrough ✅
4. **Tenets**:
   - T1 (Predictability): GPU scheduling doesn't affect 200ms P50 target ✅
   - T2 (Security): Requires privileged containers - security review needed ⚠️
   - T3 (Graceful degradation): GPU-less nodes unaffected ✅
   - T4 (Simple first): Static affinity, not dynamic sharing ✅
5. **MVP Scope**: Not in v0.1, suitable for post-MVP ✅
6. **NFR Impact**:
   - Performance: Minimal (adds one scoring weight)
   - Security: Requires policy for privileged containers
   - Reliability: No impact
7. **Priority**: P3 (Post-MVP Important)
8. **Phase**: P7 (Post-MVP Features)

**Decision**: ✅ APPROVED for P7 post-MVP, pending security policy for privileged GPU workloads

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```markdown
## Feature: GPU Scheduling Support
**CLD-REQ-020 Extension**: Add GPU resource type to scheduling

### User Story
As a ML engineer, I want to schedule GPU workloads on nodes with available GPUs so that my training jobs utilize GPU acceleration.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. GIVEN a node with GPU resources
   WHEN agent reports inventory
   THEN GPU count and model are included

2. GIVEN a workload requesting GPU
   WHEN scheduler evaluates nodes
   THEN nodes with available GPUs score higher

3. GIVEN a workload with GPU affinity
   WHEN deployed to GPU-less node
   THEN workload fails with clear error message

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Scheduler decision latency ≤200ms P50 (no regression)
- Security: GPU workloads require explicit policy approval for privileged access
- Reliability: Non-GPU workloads unaffected

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for GPU resource accounting (70%+ coverage)
- [ ] Integration test: deploy GPU workload to GPU node
- [ ] Performance: benchmark scheduler with GPU nodes
- [ ] Security: verify policy enforcement for GPU workloads

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] GPU resource specification in workload YAML
- [ ] GPU affinity configuration guide
- [ ] Policy example for GPU workloads

### Definition of Done
- [ ] CLD-REQ-020 extended with GPU resource type

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete
```

## Success Criteria

A successful product owner:
1. ✅ Every feature maps to CLD-REQ-* or has clear justification
2. ✅ MVP scope remains disciplined (v0.1 ships in P0-P5)
3. ✅ All tenets (T1-T4) upheld in feature decisions
4. ✅ NFRs (P1, A1, S1, R1, C1, M1, U1) satisfied
5. ✅ Acceptance criteria clear and testable
6. ✅ Priority aligns with phase plan (P0-P6)
7. ✅ Stakeholders understand "why" behind scope decisions
8. ✅ Product vision (§1) guides all decisions
