  Recommendations for Production Readiness

  2. Medium Priority:
    - Implement TTL-based expiration with background cleanup
    - Add API rate limiting for registry operations
    - Consider adding DNS server for standard DNS protocol support
  3. Low Priority:
    - Add pagination for ListServices
    - Add filtering/query capabilities (by label, namespace)
    - Add service versioning support



    CLD-REQ-051 Verification Report and Implementation Plan

 Critical Finding: CLD-REQ-051 is NOT Properly Implemented ⚠️

 Requirement: "CLD-REQ-051: Metadata (buckets, manifests) is strongly consistent via RAFT."

 Current State Analysis

 ✅ What Works:
 - RAFT infrastructure exists and is fully implemented (pkg/raft/store.go, pkg/raft/fsm.go)
 - Other components correctly use RAFT:
   - coordinator/membership - Node membership
   - coordinator/state_manager - Workload state
   - overlay/registry_persistent - Service registry
   - secrets/store - Secrets management

 ❌ What's Broken:
 - MetadataStore does NOT use RAFT (pkg/storage/metadata.go:16-18)
 - Uses sync.Map for in-memory storage only - NO distributed consistency
 - Has serialization methods but they're never used
 - Cannot provide strong consistency across coordinator nodes
 - Metadata is local-only, not replicated via RAFT

 Architecture Gap

 // CURRENT (WRONG):
 pkg/storage/metadata.go:
   type MetadataStore struct {
       buckets sync.Map  // ❌ In-memory only, not distributed
       objects sync.Map  // ❌ No RAFT integration
   }

 // REQUIRED:
   type MetadataStore struct {
       raftStore *raft.Store  // ✅ Distributed via RAFT
       // ... metadata operations backed by RAFT
   }

 Impact Assessment

 Severity: HIGH - Core requirement not met
 Consistency Model: Currently eventual (via in-memory cache), requires strong consistency
 Cross-Node Behavior: Metadata inconsistent across coordinator replicas
 Data Loss Risk: Metadata lost on node failure (no persistence)

 Implementation Plan

 Phase 1: Integrate MetadataStore with RAFT (60% of work)

 1. Modify MetadataStore to accept raft.Store dependency
   - Change NewMetadataStore(logger *zap.Logger) to accept raftStore *raft.Store
   - Replace sync.Map fields with RAFT-backed operations
   - All metadata mutations go through raftStore.Apply()
 2. Implement RAFT-backed metadata operations
   - CreateBucket → serialize to Command → raftStore.Apply()
   - UpdateBucket → RAFT log entry
   - DeleteBucket → RAFT log entry
   - PutObject → RAFT log entry with metadata
   - DeleteObject → RAFT log entry
 3. Update ObjectStore constructor
   - NewObjectStore() to accept raftStore *raft.Store parameter
   - Pass raftStore to NewMetadataStore(raftStore, logger)
   - Update all call sites (store.go:41)
 4. Handle FSM integration
   - Extend pkg/raft/fsm.go Command types for metadata operations
   - Add "create_bucket", "delete_bucket", "put_object_metadata", etc.
   - Implement Apply() handlers for metadata commands

 Phase 2: Write Comprehensive Tests (30% of work)

 1. Strong Consistency Tests (pkg/storage/metadata_raft_test.go)
   - Test: Metadata write on leader, read from follower (immediate consistency)
   - Test: Leader failover preserves metadata (no data loss)
   - Test: Concurrent metadata updates (serializable consistency)
   - Test: Snapshot/restore of metadata via RAFT
   - Test: Split-brain scenario (partition tolerance)
 2. Integration Tests
   - Test: ObjectStore with RAFT-backed metadata
   - Test: Bucket operations across multiple coordinators
   - Test: Object metadata replication
 3. Backwards Compatibility Tests
   - Test: Migration from sync.Map to RAFT (if needed)
   - Test: Serialization/deserialization correctness

 Phase 3: Verification (10% of work)

 1. Run tests with race detector
   - go test -race ./pkg/storage/...
   - Verify no race conditions in RAFT operations
 2. Verify coverage ≥70%
   - go test -cover ./pkg/storage/metadata*.go
   - Ensure metadata_raft_test.go covers all RAFT code paths
 3. Build and integration test
   - make build - Ensure coordinator builds
   - make test-integration - Full system test
   - make compose-up - Test in docker environment

     Lines of Code: ~500 LOC changes
     Testing: ~800 LOC new tests
     Risk: MEDIUM (changes core metadata handling)

     Recommendation

     This is NOT just a testing task - CLD-REQ-051 requires significant implementation work.

     Option 1: Implement RAFT Integration (Recommended)
     - Properly implement CLD-REQ-051
     - Follow how coordinator/membership uses RAFT as a reference
     - Strong consistency guaranteed

     Option 2: Document Gap and Defer (Alternative)
     - Add TODO comments documenting the gap
     - Create GitHub issue tracking CLD-REQ-051 non-compliance
     - Focus on testing what exists (CLD-REQ-050)

     Decision Required

     Do you want me to:
     1. Implement RAFT integration for MetadataStore (full CLD-REQ-051 compliance)?
     2. Write tests for current implementation (documents gap, doesn't fix it)?
     3. Just document the gap and move to next requirement?

     Let me know which approach you prefer, and I'll proceed accordingly.
