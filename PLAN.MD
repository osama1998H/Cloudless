Cloudless Platform Implementation Plan

     Based on your detailed product requirements, I'll build the Cloudless distributed compute platform following this structured 
     approach:

     Phase 0: Project Bootstrap & Foundation (Week 1)

     1. Initialize Go Project Structure
       - Create module structure with go.mod (Go 1.23+)
       - Set up directory hierarchy:
       /cmd/agent, /cmd/coordinator, /pkg/api, /pkg/scheduler,
     /pkg/overlay, /pkg/storage, /pkg/policy, /pkg/raft, 
     /pkg/observability, /pkg/common
     2. Development Environment
       - Create Makefile with build targets (build, test, lint, proto)
       - Set up Docker Compose for local multi-node testing
       - Configure GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
       - Add golangci-lint configuration
       - Set up protobuf/gRPC tooling
     3. Core Dependencies
       - containerd client libraries for container runtime
       - hashicorp/raft for consensus
       - quic-go for QUIC-based networking (best for NAT traversal & churn handling)
       - grpc-go for control plane communication
       - prometheus client for metrics
       - zap for structured logging

     Phase 1: Security & Membership Foundation (Week 2-3)

     1. mTLS Infrastructure
       - Certificate generation and rotation system
       - SPIFFE-inspired workload identity framework
       - Bootstrap token mechanism for node enrollment
       - Mutual authentication for all control/data paths
     2. RAFT Consensus Layer
       - Implement distributed metadata store
       - Leader election and log replication
       - Snapshot and recovery mechanisms
       - Integration tests for split-brain scenarios
     3. Node Membership
       - Agent enrollment protocol
       - Heartbeat mechanism (5s P50, 15s P95 convergence)
       - Node capability reporting (CPU, RAM, storage, bandwidth)
       - Reliability scoring system

     Phase 2: Core Control Plane (Week 4-5)

     1. Coordinator Service
       - gRPC API server with mTLS
       - Node inventory management
       - Workload lifecycle management
       - Event streaming system
     2. Basic Scheduler
       - Resource matching and bin-packing algorithm
       - Scoring function implementation:
       S = w_l*locality + w_r*reliability + w_c*cost + 
         w_u*utilization_balance - w_n*network_penalty
       - Fragment allocation tracking
       - Health probe framework
     3. Agent Core
       - containerd integration for container management
       - Resource monitoring and reporting
       - cgroups enforcement for fragments
       - Local workload state management

     Phase 3: Data Plane & Networking (Week 6-7)

     1. QUIC Overlay Network
       - Peer-to-peer mesh with QUIC streams
       - NAT traversal with STUN/TURN fallback
       - Encrypted transport by default
       - Service discovery and DNS integration
     2. Load Balancing
       - L4 load balancer implementation
       - Weighted endpoint routing
       - Locality-aware traffic distribution
       - Health-based endpoint selection

     Phase 4: Storage System (Week 8-9)

     1. Distributed Object Store
       - Content-addressed storage with checksums
       - Replication with configurable R factor (default R=3)
       - Anti-entropy repair mechanism
       - Bucket and object management APIs
     2. Storage Classes
       - Ephemeral node-local volumes
       - Hot/cold data placement
       - IOPS-based fragment allocation

     Phase 5: Operations & Polish (Week 10-11)

     1. CLI Tool (cloudlessctl)
       - Command structure: node, workload, storage, network
       - YAML/JSON manifest support
       - Interactive exec and logs
       - Formatted output options
     2. Observability
       - Prometheus metrics endpoint
       - OpenTelemetry tracing
       - Structured logging with correlation IDs
       - Event stream for audit
     3. Testing Suite
       - Unit tests with race detection
       - Integration test harness
       - Chaos testing framework (node churn, network partitions)
       - Performance benchmarks

     Implementation Priorities

     Based on your preferences, I'll implement these components in order:
     1. RAFT consensus - Foundation for distributed state
     2. mTLS authentication - Security from the start
     3. Basic scheduler - Core workload placement
     4. Container runtime - Actually run workloads

     Technical Decisions

     - Container Runtime: containerd (mature, Kubernetes-compatible)
     - Networking: QUIC streams (optimal for NAT traversal and churn tolerance)
     - Testing: Docker Compose for local multi-node simulation
     - Build: Static Go binaries with CGO disabled

     MVP Deliverables (v0.1)

     1. Functional coordinator on single VPS anchor
     2. Linux x86_64/ARM64 agents with secure enrollment
     3. Basic workload scheduling and rescheduling
     4. Encrypted overlay networking
     5. Simple replicated storage (R=2)
     6. CLI and gRPC API
     7. Basic metrics and logs

     This plan follows your P0-P6 phases while prioritizing the components you selected. The implementation will be incremental, with 
     each phase building on the previous one to create a robust distributed compute platform.
